              <h2>1-year warranty boost</h2>
              <p>ZEN cards have a very neat feature that will help you whenever your electronic devices start failing after the standard warranty ends, which is pretty common. <br /> <br /> When you buy any electronics with your ZEN shopping MastercardÂ®, their warranty gets extended by one year. How does it work? It simply does. Automatically.</p>
